Test Plan:
1. ✅ Removed key prop from FriendsList that was causing remounting
2. ✅ Added refreshTrigger prop to refresh data without remounting
3. ✅ Online users state is now preserved during navigation
4. ✅ Socket connection is maintained across screen changes
5. ✅ Improved connection handling in socket service

The issue was that the FriendsList component was being completely remounted 
every time the user returned to the home screen due to the 'key={refreshKey}' prop.

Now the component stays mounted and only refreshes its data, preserving the 
online users state and socket listeners.
