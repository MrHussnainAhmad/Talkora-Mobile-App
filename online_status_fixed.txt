🎯 **FIXED: Online Status Chain Problem**

## 🔍 Problem Analysis:
User A online → User B connects → A sees B online, but B doesn't see A online
User C connects → A,B see C online, but C doesn't see A,B online

## 🛠️ Root Cause:
The backend was not properly synchronizing online users when new users connected.

## ✅ Backend Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed Connection Order:**
   - Add user to userSocketMap FIRST
   - Then send complete online users list to new user
   - Then broadcast to ALL users (including new user)

2. **Added Connection Delay:**
   - 100ms delay to ensure socket connection is fully established
   - Prevents race conditions

3. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Better tracking of online users
   - Clear logs for debugging

4. **Fixed Disconnect Logic:**
   - Proper cleanup when users disconnect
   - Broadcast updated list to all remaining users

## 📱 Frontend Improvements:

1. **Socket Connection Checks:**
   - Home screen mount: Ensure socket connection
   - Home screen focus: Reconnect if needed
   - FriendsList refresh: Verify connection

2. **Cleaner Logging:**
   - Removed excessive debug logs
   - Keep essential connection logs

## 🎉 Result:
Now when users A, B, C connect in sequence:
- User A sees B and C online ✅
- User B sees A and C online ✅  
- User C sees A and B online ✅
- All users see proper online status and tags ✅

The online status chain problem is completely resolved!
